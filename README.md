# discord.js-template
A template for a Discord.js bot that includes command and event handlers as well as environment variables and ESLint.

## Running Locally
Make sure you have [Node.js](http://nodejs.org/) installed.
```
$ git clone git@github.com:acollierr17/discord.js-template.git # or clone your own fork
$ cd discord.js-template
$ npm install
```
Update `.env.development.example` and `.env.productione.example` with your respective details then remove `.example` from both files. Afterward, start the bot.

Your Discord.js bot should now be live! (Check the console if you need to double check anything).
